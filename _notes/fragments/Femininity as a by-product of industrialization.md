> As the ideology of femininity - a by-product of industrialization - was popularized and disseminated through the new ladies' magazines and romantic nobles, white women came to be seen as inhabitants of a sphere totally severed from the realm of productive work. ​ ​The cleavage between the home and the public economy, brought on by industrial capitalism, established female inferiority more firmly thane ver before. ​ ​"Woman" became synonymous in the prevailing propaganda with "mother"and "housewife" and both "mother" and "Housewife" bore the fatal mark of inferiority. - [[Angela Y Davis]]

In an essay written by [[Angela Y Davis]] in 1971, she explored the idea that "domestic labor was the only meaningful labor for th slave community as a whole"...."Domestic labor was a type of labor that could not be directly or indirectly claimed by the oppressor."

The way that society started to see and shape the "drudgery" of housework and it's inferior status to work done outside of the home, it was actually a source of autonomy for the black female slave, her men and her family. Through this work she was pushed to the center of the slave community, making her essential to the survival of it. And it's not to say that men did not amount of domestic labor, which is untrue. Men's tasks were not seen as superior or living higher on the hierachial scale of duties than those carried out by the women.
