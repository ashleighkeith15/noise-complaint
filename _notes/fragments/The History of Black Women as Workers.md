Black women have not had the luxioury, since the earliest days of slavery, to be "non-workers'. An overwhelming aspect of black women's lives surrounds their relationship and participation in labor. The labor during slavery was obviously compulsory, but what's interesting is the lack of separation or differientation between male and female physical slave labor for their slaveholders.

In addition to workers, black women held the roles of wife, mother and homemaker - with the last two titles being applied to not only their homes but the homes of their slaveholders (depending on the job of that slave). For the most part however, black women were predominantly agriculturial workers in the Deep South. Girls as young as 10 years old worked the cotton fields.

With no real separation of the types of physical labor between male and female slaves, female slaves may as well have been "genderless" - [Women, Race & Class](https://app.capacities.io/d3446d1a-b473-4126-ab81-904e6053f1b0/5504b258-dc00-4aad-84f4-bb30e7539459). However, black women suffered additional levels of abuse and mistreatment. Black female slaves suffered scores of sexual abuse and assault. Their fertility was an important aspect of their "usefulness" to their slaveholders - the more children you were able to have increased your value. And with the production of more children, increases the numbers of workers to participate in labor for capitalism.

While black women were experiencing pregnancy, they were not treated any different generally from their slaveholders. They were still subjected to the same abhorrent treatment, and if a slaveholder or overseer gave them any sort of lencieny - it was to make sure that her pregnancy wasn't harmed. Because with that harm is the harming of future workers which in turn is harming earning potential.

She makes a call back to [Karl Marx](https://app.capacities.io/d3446d1a-b473-4126-ab81-904e6053f1b0/0c81bdcb-0c61-4a88-a2d3-80063a6d5743)'s Capital:

> _In England women are still occasionally used instead of horses for hauling canal boats, because the labor required to produce horses and machines is an accurately known quantity, while that_ required to maintain the women of the surplus population is below all calculation.

"Required to maintain the women of the surplus population" is an interesting phrase. Is Marx saying that the surplus population are slaves, and calculating the output of their labor is an unknown quality? Meaning it is in abundance? This makes sense when thinking about the woman as an instrument to continue labor. To continuely replenish the labor source. People can also be seen as a more......consistent? or understandable source of labor. Technology may not be advanced enough to effeciently or accurately complete the tasks at hand and sometimes technology, no matter how advanced, breaks down. Same with horses and other animals. They can't, generally, be manipulated in psychological ways as advanced as people can.
