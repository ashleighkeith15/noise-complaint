> The systematic designation of slave men as “boys” by the master was a reflection, according to Elkins, of their inability to execute their fatherly responsibilities. Kenneth Stampp pursues this line of reasoning even further than Elkins: the typical slave family was matriarchal in form, for the mother’s role was far more important_ than the father’s. In so far as the family did have significance, it involved responsibilities which traditionally belonged to women, such as cleaning house, preparing food, making clothes, and raising children. The husband was at most his wife’s assistant, her companion and her sex partner. He was often thought of as her possession (Mary’s Tom), as was the cabin in which they lived - [[Women, Race and Class]] - Chap. 1 page 15

> The most fascinating point Genovese raises here—although he does not develop it—is that women often defended their men from the slave system’s attempts to demean them. Most women, perhaps a substantial majority, he says, understood that whenever their men were degraded, so too were they. Furthermore, they wanted their boys to grow up to be men and knew perfectly well that, to do so, they needed the example of a strong black man in front of them.
