Black women weren't seen as mothers - but instruments to further capital. And black men weren't seen as men - or really men at all. They were not seen as "providers" or the "head of the household". While white men saw their wives and daughters as the weaker sex, they did not (or could not) see black women as the weaker sex. These labels could then be used to give black women agency.

Male and female relations within the slave community could not, by design of their slaveholders, follow the same ideological patterns of white families. Those idealogical patterns separated the men from their women. Deeming women as the weaker sex, and regulating them to "housework" or "house making".

> In addition to workers, black women held the roles of wife, mother and homemaker - with the last two titles being applied to not only their homes but the homes of their slaveholders (depending on the job of that slave). For the most part however, black women were predominantly agricultural workers in the Deep South. Girls as young as 10 years old worked the cotton fields.


The slaveholder's definition of the black family leaned heavily on the mother, making it matrilocal in structure. "Birth records on many plantations omitted the names of the fathers, listing only the children's mothers" - [[Women, Race and Class]] There was even a term for it that state legislatures followed in the south called *partus sequitur ventrem* meaning the child follows the condition of the mother.

Herbert Gutman wrote a study on the black family in 1976. He stated/found that slave norms gave women a great degree of of premarital secual freedom, but over time those women settled into permanent marriages that equally split the familial decisions of the family between the husband and wife. His researched revealed to him the importance on community amongst slaves and in slave families including wife, husband, childrend, other relatives and adoptive kin. Slave families were popularly and frequently disrupted, however the desireto remiain together survived the devastation of slavery.

This narrative is supported throughout Harriet Jacob's Incidents of a Slave Girl, which frequently mentions the devastations that mothers felt when separated from their children come every new year. As well as their fervent desire to find their children and reuinte with them.

Gutman's research also showed how the typical ideological frameworks of how white families are structured was not mirrored in slave families:

> Everyday choices made by slave men and women—such as remaining with the same spouse for many years, naming or not naming the father of a child, taking as a wife a woman who had children by unnamed fathers, giving a newborn child the name of a father, an aunt or an uncle, or a grandparent, and dissolving an incompatible marriage—contradicted in behavior, not in rhetoric, the powerful ideology that viewed the slave as a perpetual “child” or a repressed "savage.” … Their domestic arrangements and kin networks together with the enlarged communities that flowed from these primordial ties made it clear to their children that the slaves were not “non-men” and “non-women.” - [[Women, Race and Class]]
