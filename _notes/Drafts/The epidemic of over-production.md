In the [Communist Manifesto](https://app.capacities.io/d3446d1a-b473-4126-ab81-904e6053f1b0/c6152499-8d78-41c7-bbdb-e624469e1754), [Karl Marx](https://app.capacities.io/d3446d1a-b473-4126-ab81-904e6053f1b0/0c81bdcb-0c61-4a88-a2d3-80063a6d5743) explains the epidemic of over-production that caused continued trouble for the bourgeoisie.

Through their colonisation, over consumption and over production, the bourgeoisie continualy create crisis that would never have exsisted logically without their meddling.

For example, a famine that the can create a universal war of devastation can cut off the supply of every means of subsistence, while industry and commerce also becomes destroyed. And through this destruction, the collapsed based on one piece of their over production, they threaten their own exisistence. They've created too much civilisation, too much subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce.

The productive forces at their disposal are then not furthering their development, aka becoming a hinderance and an endangerment to their property.

To overcome this, they either:

1. conquer new markets or
    
2. do a more thorough exploitation of the old ones.
    

This creates environments for future crises to become more extensive, complicated and destructive to....themselves. And through their 'overcoming' of those crises, they diminish the means where they can prevent further ones.

the action or fact of maintaining or supporting oneself at a minimum level: the minimum income needed for subsistence.
