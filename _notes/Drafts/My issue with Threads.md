- my opening position:
    
    - My merit badge of I've used every major social media platform at a pivotal age or time to do so
        
        - Like a Girl Scout badge
    - Why I think threads is a frustratingly sinister place : soft pitch
        
        - Make a list of alternative words for sinister because my brain likes to remember hyperbolic words
- What is threads
    
- What makes it technically different
    
- My observations about:
    
    - How it feels stuck in the early 2000s
        
    - The way people interact
        
    - How some people think they're "better" or doing social media better when they're doing it in a retro way
        
    - How surprised people are at how people or men act on the platform when people on Twitter understood that years ago
        
    - How running a business on this platform while trying to be a "person" causes some people to take every single post as a fucking teaching moment
