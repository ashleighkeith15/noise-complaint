- intro:
    
    - I haven't written anything personal like this since I was very young when I had too much undeserved angst and not enough intelligence to actually see the world around me
        
    - I don't know what this publication will be. I have a lot of thoughts on things as every millennial aged tumblr reject does and no where else to put them
        
    - I want to leave a legacy but if find the idea to be selfish in the current way it's thought of. I want my kids to see and hear who I was before they came, but I'd rather focus on being a supportive force in their lives day to day, not just in written form. But I want something for them to have when I'm gone. ​
        
    - As I do this more, and I will do this more, I'm assuming a sort of pattern or writing style will merge. My ego hopes so. I hope I don't assume the writing style of my favorite authors or try to sound like the other people in this app that I admire. I hope thah through time my writing can be its own . ​
        

current mini thoughts:

- the current Beyoncé discourse
    
- my favorite books from 2024
    
- Fuck Susan b Anthony
    
- Threads is one of the most sinister places on the internet and is a reminder of how lonely being a black designer is
    
- This idea in my head from woman race and class that women were some of the first industrial workers and were only pushed into the kitchen because of patriarchy so being a tradwife isn't actually true
    
    - And how being a tradwife is an exclusive white woman movement and no one seems to ask why when the answer is obvious

I haven't written anything personal like this since middle school probably. If I remember correctly, which I may be romantizising that time of my life a bit, I think I actually journalled quite a bit. If I remember anyhthing correctlty from that time in my life I remember having a lot of angst.

About what, who knows. I felt quite misunderstood during that time of my life. I was aimless, which thinking back on it now I wished I would have stayed aimless a bit longer.

As I got older I casted aside a lot fhte things that I liked doing alone, like reading, wiritng, and teaching myself how to code, in favor of typical high school activities. I thought that I was growing up. That I needed to be out running the streets with my friends and earning money so I could survive "college" which was the closest thing to the real world that I was going to get.

I'm prileveged in the fact that my parents needed nothing from me. They wanted me to be a teenager, whatever that meant to me. All of my money that I earned was mine, and as long as I went to college, they were proud nonetheless.

I've spent a lot of the years between senior year of high school and college trying to find out "who" I am. I know that I'm smart with a way of communicating and disarming people to make them feel comfortable. I believe that I'm quite funny and while I have a healthy skepticism about people, I generally find most to be good.

Running my own business and creating my own schedule has blessed me with a lot of free time. And while I struggle with feeling guilty about not using every milisecond of my free time developing my skills or getting clients, I'm slothly moving into the mindset of: _if I don't develop who I am outside of work, then I can't do the work that I find valuable._

I really fucking hate that sentence tbh. I don't work to live, and I don't want to only have hobbies that will benefit my work. But I also see my work as a form of self expression, and to accurately express myself in a way that is true to me, I feel that I need to be a complete person. And to be complete, I need to honestly explore the other sides of myself, of my curiousities.

That is what I hope this publication will be.

I have no idea what the structure of this thing will be. The only thing that I intend to do is to make it coherent and to keep it true to myself. I'm assuming overtime a structure will appear as well as my own writing style, and at that moment I'll decide whether to keep that structure or to change it.

Who fucking knows.

So here's the first installment of Noise Complaint.

## Fuck Susan B. Anthony

Let's get soem of hate out of the way. Now I don't shy away from being called a hater. I think being a hater, a true hater with reciepts and a thoughtful critque on whatever it is you're hating on, is a true artform. More of us should be haters as well as supporters. But when you hate with no receipts or just vibes, then that's just aimless hate.

And I ain't aimless hater.

For instance, I don't like Selena Gomez. I think that young lady is talentless and absolutely boring. I think her music is boring and her acting skills are beyond lackluster. However, all of my feelings or hate towards her are completely subjective. I have never met nor will I meet her. So I find it aimless and unproductive to talk indepth about her because that is a waste of time.

I have objective hate for Susan B. Anthony. I have objective receipts for why she was a piece of shit. My hate has aim, and I'm aiming straight for that broad's forehead.

If you don't know much about this wretched as former human being, here's a bit of backstory:

I think you can see where I'm going here. If you haven't, here are some direct quotes from her own crusty ass mouth:

## The left is fighting about Beyonce....again.

That title feels misleading because to me it seems like i'm saying that I'm not a part of the left. And while I'm currently trying to figure out how deep into the left that I fall, it is a portion of society that I do feels aligns as close as possible with my own politic.

Anyway, if you haven't been on "leftist miliennial black tiktok" since Christmas, you've been (rather happilily) unaware that there has been some pretty exhausitve discourse on Beyonce's performace of various Cowboy Carter songs during The Christmas Day game.

I enjoyed the performance very much, and despite not being a huge Beyonce fan, I am a listener of her music and I for fuck sure got tickets to the Renissance tour when she came to Houston, her hometown. Because come on.......when Beyonce comes to Houston, you go fuckign see it.

What I didn't expect, was the never ending loop of hot takes and divisive hot takes that happened on tiktok afterwards. But when I say divisive, I don't mean it nessecarily in the negative sense? Is there a word that means the same as divisive but is more positive?

I use that word because I think there were some interesting lines drawn in the sand around identity politics, how the black communitiy deals with colorism and mixed-raceness, and regional identity politics. Do I agree with the lines drawn? Not all of them - however, I did find it interesting to hear what some people were thinking and their reasonsings.

To make a very long story short, a biracial creator nameed Hannah made a video critiquing Beyonce's performace and calling it propoganda. She makes a few points in the video that I don't agree with, but overall I found the take to be lukewarm and from the propective of someone that doesn't understand southern black culture in a way that isn't surface level or binary. In her apology video a week later, she said as much (I saw a recap of her apology video, I didn't care enough to watch it for various reasons).

Here's my attempt to summarize the discourse that came out surrounding that video:

1. Biracial black people, specfically ones with white mothers, have a lack of a connection to the black experience in America. The consensus or theory was that since the mothers do a large portion of developing the......cultural aspects? of child development - having a white mother means that child will have more of a connection to "white culture". The darker side of this arguement starts to feel very race science with people trying to guess who has a white mother based on their physical features which......what the fuck.
    
    1. There's one take around this that I agree with and that I thought was interesting. Han, the creator of the proproganda video, does have a white mother. She's mentioned this before. And while the internet was critiquing her and her ancestory (which.....I found to be weird, however, when you are discussing race like she did in her video, then you have to understand that you open that up for people to discuss in your regard), she was apparently deleting comments, blocking people, saying people were bullying her. Another video that I stumbled on gave this idea:
        
        1. Han's response to the discourse reminds us of her white womanness and her weaponization of that part of her identity. The creator of this video thought she was using her "white woman tears" as a way to skurt around the critiques and to victimize herself. The creator then goes on to say that learning how to weaponize your tears is not something that a black woman can teach you - only a white woman can.
            
        2. I find this idea to be interesting and I agree with it.....
            
2. There's a overall feeling or concensus in the black community that black people from the south are stupid or they don't know any better. Comments made about how could you live in a state like Texas or Missisippi knowing how conversative and racist those states are, and how uneducated us southerns are and blah blah blah. I found those takes to the easiest to ignore, because any basic research into the history of this country, the history of music and art, etc. has some sort of root or seedling that comes from the south. It's just a very stupid argument made from people that let the media shill them stories about how helpless we are down here. It ain't a secret that the politics in the south are fucking terrible (I was raised in Louisiana and I currently live in Houston) but growing up intersectionally black, in the south, and educated means that we all see the world and this country with a different type of flavor and resillency that will only strengthen the community and the message.
    
3. The black community has a hugeeeeee way to go when it comes to how we discuss and treat our biracial community members. There's still a lot of deep seated dismissiveness, colorism, and lack of empathy that I deluded myself in thinking was slowly falling out of the mainstream discourse. I'll link to some biracial creators that talked about it more specifically, since I am not biracial and I do not want to speak over or for them.
    
    1. This discourse was the first time I ever heard the term monoracial as well but that might be just my own ignorance.

My biggest issues with Hannah's take was that I think she has a very surface level thinking of what patriotism is when certain groups are expressing it. From my understanding of her video, she thinks that the proproganda of Beyonce's performance would result in the increase of American patriotism. From my video, she seems to see this as a bad thing. And I can understand, and partially agree, with why she thinks so. When American patirosim is expressed it's usually in relation to imperalism, militarism, and nationalism. However, I do not believe that to be fully true when black people express "patriotism". I do not believe that there is a black person in this country that woudl look at the american flag, and say they are "proud" to be from this imperialistic ass fucking country. That's not what we're saying. We're expressing pride in the development of those country that our people had a hand in. She mentions that Beyonce could have used another flag, like the Black American Flag, but that is literally not the fucking point. I believe she used the flag to reclaim it and to remind the white audeince that this flag doesn't just belong to you and people that look like you. It's ours too. And it has more than one meaning.

Whether or not you think she reclaimed that flag successfully is another issue.

I think this discourse is really just a case of "somewhat ok message, wrong messenger". I do not think that someone else, such as a dark skinned black woman, critquing Beyonce with a similar stance would have recieved this much backlash. But who knows.

## My favorite book of 2024: Tar Baby by Toni Morrison

I have yet to read an author that I believe to be flawless. Maybe I haven't read enough. Maybe since I read Beloved at a young age (middle school I believe) and that happened to be such a pivotal time in the discovering of my own womanhood and what it mean to be black on top of that is the reason why I am completely enamored by Toni Morrison. I find her to be one of the best, if not the best writer of all time, and to think that I share a similar identity with someone so full of talent, emotion, and care of her craft makes me want to fucking cry.

I think the last time that I took notes on a fiction book was in college and I'm sure they were shitty. While reading Tar Baby this winter, I couldn't help but taking notes on everything that I was feeling and thinking. Each character was crafted with such care and attention. Each so rich that even if you hated them, you felt them. They were real. The tension in the air, the things unsaid, things spoken with the body, the suspense. I have never read a book that made me interrogate my own internalized anti-blackness before. For which I erroreously thought I had none. But I knew that I had work to do becuase I could not understand at first why Willie as a whole, unsettled me so much. I feel like I'll write a much longer piece about this because just recalling it now makes me breathless. And afraid.

I cried in the bathroom at work the day the world found out she passed away. The day of her birth and of her passing are recurring days in my calendar. I will not work on those days. I will do what I think she would want me to do: I will pour into my own hobbies, pour into myself, move this black body and be black as fuck.
