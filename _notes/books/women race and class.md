The legacy of slavery: standards for a new womanhood

In the early days of slavery, around the early 1900s, many scholars thought that they understood the complexities of slavery and chose to write about the "peculiar institution". Ulrich B. Phillips declared that slavery gave civilization to the the African savages. Many of those scholars failed to expand on the particular situations and complexities of being a female slave.
Herbert Gutman attempted to exlore this in his investigation of the Black family. He believed that not much made them different from their white counterparts if only that Black women's domestic aspirations were thwarted by slavery.
Since scholars have not done a deep enough analysis of the black female slaves and all they faced, Davis proposes some of her own ideas to guide the reexamination of the history of black women during slavery.
Black women as workers
Black women, back then and even now, have a large portion of their lives involving work outside of the home. During slavery, women were seen as chattel just like the men were, so work is what they did primarily.
“The slave woman was first a fulltime worker for her owner, and only incidentally a wife, mother and homemaker.” - Kenneth M. Stampp "The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Antebellum South"
Black women were anomalies when it came to the 19th century ideology of femininity aka the gentle companions and nurturing mothers. Media from back then, like Uncle Tom's Cabin or Sambo, depicted women as being mammies, cooks or maids, in actuality 7/8 slaves, men and women alike, were agricultural or field workers. One woman, Jenny Proctor,  interviewed in 1930s from Alabama describes being sent to work the cotton patch at 10 years old.
While the oppression of men and women slaves under the masters was the same, in addition, women suffered secual abuse and other barbaric treatments which could only really be inflicted on women. Black women tettered the line of the genderlessness frequently. When their womanly biologically qualities were needed, they were locked into those roles exclusively.
This issue increased as the international slave trade was beginning to be abolished because there would be no more "new slaves" to retrieve across borders. This forced the slave masters to resort to reproductive means.
This turned black women into "breeders" in the eyes of white people. Black women, that could still bare children, weren't seen as women and weren't given the respected status of womanhood. Their purpose, and their value, were calculated in their terms of their ability to multiply the slave population.
And because "breeders" don't have "children" in the respected sense, their children were sold away like "calves from cows". A South Carolina court even ruled that female slaves had no legal claims to their children and that the "young of slaves...stand on the same footing as other animals".
Because slave holders saw black women and men as genderless, their sexist attitudes had no place in how they saw their slaves. They couldn't risk labeling the women as "weaker" because that would mean they acknowledge the men as "stronger". That could give them agency.
