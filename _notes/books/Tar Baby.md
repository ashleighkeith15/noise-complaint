Page 191:

- Valerian thinks everyone else is defending personnel and property that isn’t there’s. While true, the other memebers of the story have a fucked up sense of ownership technically (jade syndey and ondine) valerian is missing the point because of his status as the head of the house. Since he doesn’t see his property or his person agressed on, then it must not be true. But we’ve seen it happen. And when you position the other members as having power, just enough of it, you give them agency and the idea to protect what is there’s.
- He’s also missing the idea of good blacks vs bad blacks, which jade really digs into on her own and when she talks to Margaret about the man. Calling him a nigger, then balking at Margaret calling him a gorilla is absurd.

Page 132

Why does Willie, the man, only tell his name to Valerian, even after Jade had already asked?

Around the same pages when he first talks to valerian in the greenhouse:

- why is he talking like that….with slang and broken English? Did not talk like that with jade

At gideons and therese house:

- amazing how men act when they’re around another man after being around women for so long. Hard patriarchy

Willie playing the piano at the house:

- he’s playing everyone. Obviously. Thinks just by apologizing what he did to jade is ok. I apologized why cant that be enough. Because something you saw as property won’t go back to its property status. He’s put back by her agency. Why she won’t tell valerian pissed me off at first but I’m starting to understand. He sees her as property too.

His name is Willie, but he’s referred to as Son. Which he said was one of his many names and the only one that felt right. And I can understand the draw that has for valerian considering his relationship with Michael.

Willie talks to ondine:

It’s been a few times that it’s been referenced directly or indirectly how less alarming he looks now that he’s cleaned up. Ondine even says she’s more inclined to believe him when he’s said he’s here do to no harm even tho a shower doesn’t change behavior. He’s still an unknown threat. With boundary issues.

Syndey talks to Willie

Another proclaimer of property. “This is my place only I can invite you in here” like ondine isn’t a person. And then concedes that it’s valerians house and how black people are just play things to valerian.

Another instance of property: Willie’s retelling of him punching the snapper and being upset that the fish asserted itself instead of “wanting” to surrender to him and his pleasure

Jesus Christ the feet shit. Such a manipulator. Scaring people into doing what he wants, disregarding her agency. And then his demeanor afterwards?! “Leading the way” “he drove us home” Jesus Christ he has a fucked up sense of relationships. Everything is a power struggle that he think he’s not participating in.

Now jadine is made at Margaret because she thinks he wants her. Jadine is…….feels…..comforted by his want of her? Right before the start of chapter 6.

“What was unthinkable in Philly was not so on the island” written after valerian invited the staff and Willie to dinner when none of the invited guests show. Sydney loves the idea seing it “as a special and intimate relationships with his employer”

Willie’s conversation with Margaret

- Willie down plays so much of how he was caught that it’s so manipulative. Almost like he refuses to believe that since he thinks he has nothing, that he can’t take anything from anyone else. Especially without physical force. “Your husband saw I didn’t mean any harm” but that doesn’t matter. Your actions do not match your intentions. He plays like he doesn’t under stand that
- Again he is not using broken English with her but just with valerian?

Christmas dinner!!

- valerian didn’t tell anyone he fired yard man for stealing…..but Willie is right there. Is it becuase he hired yard man to work that the stealing is different? Becuase he believes them to be above Willie?
- Willie’s thoughts about waste are really great.

Page 290:

- the way that Willie flip flops about jadine is insane. With the way that he was acting at Christmas, he wanted her to act like that towards him and not valerian. To do all those things for him. Be his property.

Margaret confronts ondine about hurting Micheal

- this bitch as a lot of nerve. Why didn’t you stop me? I was nineteen and weren’t you 35? ONDINE WAS 23.
- The fucked aging of “the help” or black women and the perpetual girlhood of white women is just so gross.
- And how she’s walking around forcing valerian to hear her story so she doesn’t have to bear it alone?!
