[Commune of Paris | Causes, Consequences & Legacy](https://www.britannica.com/event/Commune-of-Paris-1871)

An insurrection of Paris against the French government from March 18 - May 29th, 1871. It occured after the French were defeated in the Franco-German War and collapse of Napoleon's Second Empire.

The repulblican Parisians feared that the National Aseembly meeting in Feby 1871 that were meeting in Versailles would restore the monarchy, so the head of the national government - Adolphe Theirs - chose to disarm the National Guard. Now the guard was made of primarily of workers who fought during the siege of Paris. Resistance breaks out in Paris when the cgovernemnt tries to remove the cannons of the guard overlooking the city.

Days later, elections are held by the central committe of the guard which resulted in a victory of for the revolutionaries that then establish their own Commune government. Among the new government contained three groups - Jacobins, Proudhonists, and the Blanquistes.

Jacobins who followed the French Revolutionary tradition of 1793 and wanted the commune to control the Revolution.

Proudhonists who were socialists who supported a federation of communes throughout the country.

Blanquistes who were socialists that wanted violent action.

Overall, the commune called for things such as the endo of support for religion and the 10 hour workday. The government focused on Paris after squashing a bunch of other communes quickly. At the end of the day, the Federes (aka the insurgents) weren't able to organize themselves militarily and take the offensive, so on May 21st the governemnt entered an undefended section of Paris and commeced a week called _la semaine sanglante_ or the bloody week. In defense, the Communards set up barricades and burned publick buildings, and about 20,000 insurrectionists were killed along with about 750 troops. In the aftermath of the commune, the governement arrested 38,000 and deported more than 7,000 people.
