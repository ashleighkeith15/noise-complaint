The Factories Act 1847, also known as the Ten Hours Act was a United KingdomAct of Parliament which restricted the working hours of women and young persons (13–18) in textile mills to 10 hours per day. The practicalities of running a textile mill were such that the Act should have effectively set the same limit on the working hours of adult male mill-workers.
The Factory Act 1847 stipulated that as of 1 July 1847, women and children between the ages of 13 and 18 could work only 63 hours per week. The Bill further stipulated that as of 1  May 1848, women and children 13–18 could work only 58  hours per week, the equivalent of 10 hours per day.
